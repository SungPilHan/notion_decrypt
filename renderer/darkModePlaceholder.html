 darkModePlaceholder.html

 A placeholder page we load in new tabs when we're running in dark mode to
 prevent a white flash. The underlying issue is that Chromium resets the
 renderer on each new tab's first load which means it always renders a white
 box. That's very jarring in dark mode. We could wait until the actual page
 is loaded to show the tab but that can take a long time. Instead we load
 this placeholder (which is relatively quick) and load the actual page
 immediately after. Not ideal but better than the alternatives
